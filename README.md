# Prowler: AWS CIS Benchmark Tool

## Description

Tool based on AWS-CLI commands for AWS account hardening, following guidelines of the [CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations Benchmark 1.1 ](https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/tools2/amazon/CIS_Amazon_Web_Services_Foundations_Benchmark_v1.1.0.pdf)

It covers hardening and security best practices for all regions related to:

- Identity and Access Management (24 checks)
- Logging (8 checks)
- Monitoring (15 checks)
- Networking (5 checks)

For a comprehesive list and resolution look at the guide on the link above.

## Requirements
This script has been written in bash using AWS-CLI and it works in Linux and OSX.

- Make sure your AWS-CLI is installed on your workstation, with Python pip already installed:
```
pip install awscli
```
Or install it using "brew", "apt", "yum" or manually from https://aws.amazon.com/cli/

- Previous steps, from your workstation:
```
git clone https://github.com/mberger/aws-cis-security-benchmark
cd aws-cis-security-benchmark
```

- Make sure you have properly configured your AWS-CLI with a valid Access Key and Region:
```
aws configure
```

- Make sure your Secret and Access Keys are associated to a user with proper permissions to do all checks. To make sure add SecurityAuditor default policy to your user. Policy ARN is

```
arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/SecurityAudit
```
> In some cases you may need more list or get permissions in some services, look at the Troubleshooting section for a more comprehensive policy if you find issues with the default SecurityAudit policy.

## How to create a report

1 - Run the prowler.sh command without options (it will use your default credentials and run checks over all regions when needed, default region is us-east-1):

```
./prowler
```

2 - For custom AWS-CLI profile and region, use the following: (it will use your custom profile and run checks over all regions when needed):

```
./prowler -p custom-profile -r us-east-1
```

3 - For a single check use option -c:

```
./prowler -c check310
```
or for custom profile and region
```
./prowler -p custom-profile -r us-east-1 -c check11
```
or for a group of checks use group name:
```
./prowler -c check3
```

Valid check numbers are based on the AWS CIS Benchmark guide, so 1.1 is check11 and 3.10 is check310

4 - If you want to save your report for later analysis:
```
./prowler > prowler-report.txt
```
or if you want a colored HTML report do:
```
pip install ansi2html
./prowler | ansi2html -la > report.html
```

5 - For help use:

```
./prowler -h

USAGE:
      prowler -p <profile> -r <region> [ -v ] [ -h ]
  Options:
      -p <profile>  specify your AWS profile to use (i.e.: default)
      -r <region>   specify a desired AWS region to use (i.e.: us-east-1)
      -c <checknum> specify a check number from the AWS CIS benchmark (i.e.: check11 for check 1.1)
      -h            this help

```
## How to fix all WARNINGS:
 Check your report and fix the issues following all specific guidelines per check in https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/tools2/amazon/CIS_Amazon_Web_Services_Foundations_Benchmark_v1.1.0.pdf

## Troubleshooting

### STS expired token
If you are using an STS token for AWS-CLI and your session is expired you probably get this error:

```
A client error (ExpiredToken) occurred when calling the GenerateCredentialReport operation: The security token included in the request is expired
```
To fix it, please renew your token by authenticating again to the AWS API.

### Custom IAM Policy
Instead of using default policy SecurityAudit for the account you use for checks you may need to create a custom policy with a few more permissions (get and list, not change!) here you go a good example for a "ProwlerPolicyReadOnly":

```
